### üèÅ Running the Application
1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory and start the server.
```bash

   node server.mjs
```
2. **Start the Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` (root) directory and start the development server. 
```bash
  npm run build
  npm run dev
```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add your Discord webhook URL to the `.env` file:

.env
```
